            {"id": 2, "q": "How is a wave-cut platform formed?", "a": "Steep cliffs are eroded between the low-water mark and the high-water mark.

        "topic_name": "Weather",
        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "q": "Describe a Stevenson screen and explain why it is used.", "a": "A Stevenson screen is a wooden box standing on four legs of height about 120cm. The screen is raised so that air temperature can be measured. The sides of the box are slatted to allow air to enter freely. The roof is usually made of double boarding to prevent the Sun's heat from reaching the inside of the screen. Insulation is further improved by painting the outside of the screen white to reflect much of the Sun's energy. The screen is usually placed on a grass-covered surface, thereby reducing the radiation of heat from the ground."},
            {"id": 2, "q": "Name the instruments used to measure: (a) humidity (b) wind speed.", "a": "(a) Wet- and dry-bulb thermometer (b) Anemometer"},
            {"id": 3, "q": "Distinguish between cirrus and cumulonimbus clouds.", "a": "Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy, high-altitude clouds, formed of ice crystals. Cumulonimbus are thick clouds extending from low altitude to high altitude, and are associated with heavy downpours and sometimes thunder and lightning."}

    "2.5": {
        "topic_name": "Climate and natural vegetation",
        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "q": "Describe the characteristics of (a) equatorial climate and (b) hot desert climate.", "a": "(a) Equatorial areas have: high annual temperatures year round (26–27°C); low seasonal ranges (1–2°C), but greater diurnal (daily) ranges (10–15°C); high rainfall throughout the year (more than 2000mm). (b) Hot deserts have: high daytime temperatures (30–40°C) throughout the year; a large temperature difference, often as much as 50°C between day and night; unreliable and low rainfall (about 250mm/year)."},
            {"id": 2, "q": "(a) Why do equatorial areas receive more heat than polar areas? (b) How does temperature change with altitude?", "a": "(a) Areas that are close to the Equator receive more heat than areas that are close to the Poles because incoming solar radiation is concentrated near the Equator, but dispersed near the Poles. In addition, insolation near the Poles has to pass through a greater amount of atmosphere and there is more chance of it being reflected back out to space. (b) Temperature decreases with altitude. On average, it drops about 1°C for every 100 metres."},
            {"id": 3, "q": "Describe the characteristics of tropical rainforest vegetation.", "a": "Vegetation in the rainforest is evergreen. Photosynthesis and growing can happen all year. The vegetation is layered, and the shape of the crowns varies with the layer, in order to receive maximum light. It is very diverse — there are up to 200 species of tree per hectare. Trees at the top of the canopy are adapted to being in the light; those near the ground are adapted to being in the shade. The trees have buttress roots to help stabilise them."},
            {"id": 4, "q": "How do plants adapt to desert conditions?", "a": "Plants adapt to deserts by: growing deep roots or wide roots; producing only a few leaves, to reduce transpiration (moisture loss); storing water; and producing seeds that wait for rainfall before growing and completing a very quick life cycle."}
